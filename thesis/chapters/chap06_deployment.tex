\chapter{Deployment}
\label{chap:deployment}
% brief introduction into the chapter 
\section{Current Deployment Strategy}
\label{sec:current-deployment-strategy}
%  introduce the current deployment strategy of project
%  the deployment is managed using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) on AWS, use of specific services (Amazon S3 for hosting the static frontend and AWS Lambda for the backend functionality)
% how these components are organized into multiple stacks using AWS cloudformation

\subsection{Amazon S3 for Static Frontend Hosting}
\label{subsec:amazon-s3-static-frontend}
% how Amazon S3 is used for storing and serving the static ReactJS app

\subsection{AWS Lambda for Backend Services}
\label{subsec:aws-lambda-backend}
% use of AWS Lambda for the backend
% discussing how serverless architecture benefits the application, including scalability, cost-efficiency, and reduced operational overhead.

\subsection{AWS CloudFormation for Infrastructure Management}
\label{subsec:aws-cloudformation-infrastructure}
% the role of AWS cloudformation in managing the infrastructure.
% consistent, repeatable deployment processes

\section{Alternative Deployment Methods}
\label{sec:alternative-deployment-methods}
% This section should explore alternative deployment methods that could be used for the project. 

\subsection{Containerization}
\label{subsec:containerization}
% concept of containerization, particularly using Docker
% how containerization could be applied to both the frontend and backend

\subsection{Other Cloud Providers and Services}
\label{subsec:other-cloud-providers}
% Briefly touching on alternative cloud providers (like Azure or Google Cloud Platform) and their services that could be used for a similar deployment strategy.

\section{Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)}
\label{sec:cicd}
% Dedicate this section to the CI/CD processes implemented in the project, emphasizing the use of GitHub Actions.

\subsection{GitHub Actions for CI/CD}
\label{subsec:github-actions-cicd}
% how GitHub Actions are used for CI/CD
% details on how code changes in the repository trigger automated workflows for building, and deploying both the frontend and backend components

\subsection{Workflow Automation and Pipeline}
\label{subsec:workflow-automation-pipeline}
% specific steps involved in  CICD pipeline, including code commits, automated testing, build processes, and deployment to AWS services.
